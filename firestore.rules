/**
 * This ruleset is configured for an initial development and testing phase.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * Access is currently open to allow for rapid prototyping and UI development of the
 * Admin Panel without requiring an authentication layer. This is a temporary state.
 *
 * <strong>WARNING:</strong> These rules are insecure and MUST NOT be used in a production
 * environment. Before deploying, you must implement a proper authentication
 * and authorization model (e.g., role-based access control).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Open Access for Prototyping: The rules are temporarily set to `allow read, write: if true;`
 *   which grants open read/write access to all collections.
 *   This is to facilitate development as requested.
 * - Future-Ready Structure: The rules are structured per-collection, making it easy
 *   to apply granular security later.
